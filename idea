A budget app is an application that helps you keep track of your income and expenses. The basic logic behind the app is as follows:

1. Income: First, you'll need to input your monthly income into the app. This can include your salary, any freelance work, or other sources of income.

2. Expenses: Next, you'll need to list all your monthly expenses, including rent/mortgage payments, utilities, food, entertainment, transportation, and any other bills you need to pay.

3. Categorize Expenses: You can categorize your expenses as fixed or variable. Fixed expenses are recurring expenses that stay the same each month, while variable expenses change each month.

4. Calculate Total Income and Expenses: Once you have entered all your income and expenses, the app will calculate your total monthly income and expenses.

5. Analyze Your Budget: The app will show you how much money you have left over after deducting your expenses from your income. This will help you determine if you need to adjust your spending habits.

6. Set Goals: You can set goals for saving money or paying off debt. The app will help you track your progress towards achieving your goals.

7. Alert: You can set up alerts for when you are approaching your budget limit in a certain category or for when a bill is due.

There are several no-code tools available to create budgeting apps, such as Glide, Thunkable, Bubble, and Adalo. You can use these tools to create your app without needing to write any code. These platforms usually have drag-and-drop interfaces, pre-built templates, and tutorials to help you get started.
