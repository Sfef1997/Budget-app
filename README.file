## Code Overview

The code consists of the following main components:

- Variables: The script declares variables to store references to various HTML elements and other data.
- Event Listeners: Event listeners are added to the "Set Budget" and "Check Amount" buttons to handle user interactions.
- Functions:
  - `calcBudget()`: This function initializes the budget calculator and adds event listeners.
  - `checkAmount()`: This function is called when the "Check Amount" button is clicked. It adds the expense to the expenses array, updates the total expenses and remaining amount, and calls other functions for further calculations.
  - `createExpensesList()`: This function creates the HTML markup for displaying the expenses list.
  - `deleteItem()`: This function handles the deletion of an expense from the list and updates the total expenses and remaining amount accordingly.
  - `editElement()`: This function handles the editing of an expense from the list and updates the total expenses and remaining amount accordingly.
  - `calculatePercentage()`: This function calculates the percentage of expenses relative to the budget and displays a visual indicator based on the calculated percentage.
